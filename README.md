This is a Light Stalk [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) Framework Class project.

By [definition](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework) , a framework is a set of codes that dictates the application of flow control.

Based on this I created a class that has the main purpose of enabling you to create a basic framework for PHP projects , allowing simple way you can better organize the logic of your application , supporting , including the use of the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) approach.

**Installing**

To get started, simply use the composer to import a example application using the comand:
`composer create-project thiagotoledo/copacabanaexample:2.0 CopacabanaExample`

**Dependences**

The Copacabana Framework need a mod_rewrite mode is on and [the Composer project](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. 

If you need more a help about mod_rewrite this you can see [this good article](http://jaydson.org/habilitar-mod_rewrite-no-apache/).
